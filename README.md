This was my Programming 2 Examination program, designed to fill all the criteria for an A in the course. It is the entire VIsual Studio workspace folder

-------------HOW TO PLAY-----------------

Once you have selected a difficulty, you can move around using WASD

The goal of the game is to find a key, then enter the goal (The green square)

The key is located in one of the boxes (the colored one on Easy and Medium dificulty), and collide with the box from the right direction.

Once you have the key and touched the goal, your score and entered username in the bottom left is submitted to the score database, which is displayed when you press the leaderboard button.
